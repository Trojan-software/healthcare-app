Developer Options in Android are a set of advanced settings intended primarily for app developers. These settings provide tools and functionalities that help developers test, debug, and optimize their applications. Common features include enabling USB debugging, showing CPU usage, capturing bug reports, and more.
Security Implications: - USB Debugging: Exposes device data to connected computers. - OEM Unlocking: Can lead to rooting, bypassing security controls. - Mock Locations: Can be used to spoof location data. - General System Exposure: Enabling Developer Options increases the attack surface.

		▪	Isolating Health Care Clearinghouse Functions
(Required)
If a health care clearinghouse is part of a larger organization, the clearinghouse must implement policies and procedures that protect the electronic protected health information of the clearinghouse from unauthorized access by the larger organization.
▪	Access Authorization (Addressable)
Implement policies and procedures for granting access to electronic protected health information, for example, through access to a workstation, transaction, program, process, or other mechanism.
▪	Access Establishment and Modification (Addressable) Implement policies and procedures that, based upon the entity's access authorization policies, establish, document, review, and modify a user's right of access to a workstation, transaction, program, or process.

Implementing Developer options protection in Android applications is crucial to ensure security and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive features and data. Implementing Developer option protection in your Android application enhances its security and integrity. By detecting and responding to the enabling of developer options, you can prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data.
The application does not protect itself from launching if developer option is turned on.
 

 
To detect whether Developer Options are enabled on an Android device, you can use the Settings.Global API in Android. Here’s how you can do it in Java or Kotlin.
Java:

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity { @Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
{ super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

if (isDeveloperOptionsEnabled(this)) {
// show a warning and exit the app
} else {
// continue the app...
}
}

public static boolean isDeveloperOptionsEnabled(Context context) {
int devOptions = Settings.Global.getInt(context.getContentResolver(), Settings.Global.DEVELOPMENT_SETTINGS_ENABLED, 0);
return devOptions == 1;
}

}

Kotlin:

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() { override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
if (isDeveloperOptionsEnabled(this)) {
// show a warning and exit the app
} else {
// continue the app...
}
}

private fun isDeveloperOptionsEnabled(context: Context): Boolean { val devOptions = Settings.Global.getInt(context.contentResolver,
Settings.Global.DEVELOPMENT_SETTINGS_ENABLED, 0)
return devOptions == 1
}

}


Running an application in Developer options enabled environment can expose security risks, impact performance, and affect user experience.
