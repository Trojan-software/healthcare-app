Another scenario is if your application provides data to the user that always requires an Internet connection to retrieve data, such as email. In this case, you might find that it's easier to build a WebView in your Android application that shows a web page with all the user data, rather than performing a network request, then parsing the data and rendering it in an Android layout.

Risk Assessment		

WebView can be susceptible to various exploits including client side Javascript injection and network sniffing if improperly implemented.

When using WebView, ensure the following:

▪	Use WebView to load only trusted content
▪	Always load resources over HTTPS
▪	Avoid using Javascript within WebView. If Javascript is absolutely required, be sure that each context is escaped properly by using an XSS filter component such as the OWASP Java Encoder Project
▪	Accept only plain-text user input and sanitize it before displaying in WebView


An improperly implemented WebView instance may be vulnerable to XSS can be used to gain access to shared preference files using file:///. When Javascript is enabled, it may allow adversaries to perform XSS attacks. Furthermore, not loading WebView over HTTPS may allow attackers to sniff data from network transmissions and perform Man-in-the-Middle attack by injecting arbitrary JavaScript into the WebView.
