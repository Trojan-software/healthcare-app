  To create a baseline, run `gradlew updateLintBaseline` after adding the following to the module's build.gradle file:
  ```
  android {
      lint {
          baseline = file("lint-baseline.xml")
      }
  }
  ```

  /Users/builder/clone/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:13: Error: Avoid hardcoding the debug mode; leaving it out allows debug and release builds to automatically assign one [HardcodedDebugMode]
          android:debuggable="false"
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
     Explanation for issues of type "HardcodedDebugMode":
     It's best to leave out the android:debuggable attribute from the manifest.
     If you do, then the tools will automatically insert android:debuggable=true
     when building an APK to debug on an emulator or device. And when you
     perform a release build, such as Exporting APK, it will automatically set
     it to false.
  
     If on the other hand you specify a specific value in the manifest file,
     then the tools will always use it. This can lead to accidentally publishing
     your app with debug information.
