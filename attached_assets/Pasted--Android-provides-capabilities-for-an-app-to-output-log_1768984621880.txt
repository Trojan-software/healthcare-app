
Android provides capabilities for an app to output logging information and obtain log output. Applications can send information to log output using the android.util.Log class. To obtain log output, applications can execute the logcat command.

Facebook SDK for Android contained the following code which sends Facebook access tokens to log output in plain text format.
Log.d("Facebook-authorize", "Login Success! access_token=" + getAccessToken() + " expires=" + getAccessExpires());
Here is another example. A weather report for Android sent a user's location data to the log output as follows:

I/MyWeatherReport( 6483): Re-use MyWeatherReport data I/ ( 6483): GET JSON:
http://example.com/smart/repo_piece.cgi? arc=0&lat=26.209026&lon=127.650803&rad=50&dir=-999&lim=52&category=1000
If a user is using Android OS 4.0 or before, other applications with READ_LOGS permission can obtain the user's location information without declaring ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission in the manifest file.


Never use logs in production. Find all Log.d() and remove them.

Use exception parsers and crash-based-analytics tool capture crashes in production so that it can be debugged


Sensitive data can inadvertently leak into the logs and may aid in further attacks
