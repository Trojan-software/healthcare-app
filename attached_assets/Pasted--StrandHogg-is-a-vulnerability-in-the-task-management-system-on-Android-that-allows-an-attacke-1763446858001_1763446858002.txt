 


StrandHogg is a vulnerability in the task management system on Android that allows an attacker to hijack tasks. This can be exploited such that when the end user starts a legitimate app, instead of actually getting that app, the user is presented with a malicious look-a-like instead.

Risk Assessment		

One or more than one public facing activities of the application is vulnerable to StandHogg vulnerability.
 
In StrandHogg and regular task hijacking, malicious applications typically deploy one of the following techniques or a selection in tandem:
▪	Task Affinity Manipulation: The malicious application leverages two activities, M1 and M2, wherein M2.taskAffinity = com.victim.app and M2.allowTaskReparenting = true. In the eventuality that the malicious app is opened on M2, M2 would be relocated to the front and the user will interact with the malicious application once the victim application has initiated.
▪	Single Task Mode: In the eventuality that the victim application sets launchMode to singleTask, malicious applications can leverage M2.taskAffinity = com.victim.app to hijack the victim's application task stack.
▪	Task Reparenting: In the eventuality that the victim application sets taskReparenting to true, malicious applications can move the victim's application task to the malicious application's stack.
However, in the case of StrandHogg 2.0, all exported activities without a launchMode of singleTask or singleInstance are affected on vulnerable Android versions.
The launchMode for public activity com.web2native.MainActivity is set as singleTask. As a result, a malicious applications can leverage taskAffinity='com.victim.app' to hijack the victim's application task stack.
A new activity is launched with flag FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK set in LA4/m;->invoke(Ljava/lang/ Object;)Ljava/lang/Object; [access_flags=public final] @ 0xdd8f0. As a result, a malicious applications can leverage taskAffinity='com.victim.app' to hijack the victim's application task stack.
A new activity is launched with flag FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK set in LG2/a;->d(Landroid/webkit/ WebView; Ljava/lang/String;)Z [access_flags=public] @ 0x15d3f4. As a result, a malicious applications can leverage taskAffinity='com.victim.app' to hijack the victim's application task stack.
A new activity is launched with flag FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK set in Lx4/q2;->invokeSuspend(Ljava/ lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object; [access_flags=public final] @ 0x3d066c. As a result, a malicious applications can leverage taskAffinity='com.victim.app' to hijack the victim's application task stack.
A new activity is launched with flag FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK set in Lx4/g0;->run()V [access_flags=public final] @ 0x3c73f8. As a result, a malicious applications can leverage taskAffinity='com.victim.app' to hijack the victim's application task stack.
A new activity is launched with flag FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK set in Lx4/Y2;-
>getBase64FromBlobData(Ljava/lang/String;)V [access_flags=public final] @ 0x3d4208. As a result, a malicious applications can leverage taskAffinity='com.victim.app' to hijack the victim's application task stack.

A malicious app could leverage this weakness to manipulate the way in which users interact with the app. Specifically, this could be instigated by relocating a malicious attacker-controlled activity in the screen flow of the user, which may prove useful towards performing phishing, DoS or user-credential capture. This issue has been verified as a known exploit leveraged by banking malware Trojans in the past.
