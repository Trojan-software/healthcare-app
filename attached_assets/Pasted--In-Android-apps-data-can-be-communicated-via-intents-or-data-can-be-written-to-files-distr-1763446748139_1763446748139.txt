In all these cases, if the data is sensitive, it is important to keep the data secure. That is, it should not be possible for other apps (or, more strictly, apps with different userids) to be able to access this data, or for the data to be accessible to other programs or people, if the data owner does not intend that.
Data security (for non-intent communication channels) can be supported by creating the file, shared preference or database with MODE_PRIVATE on internal storage or with MODE_PRIVATE and encrypted (using secure encryption techniques, and using an encryption key only secure parties/apps have) on external storage. MODE_PRIVATE is a constant defined by the class android.content.Context. It may be used as the mode parameter in the methods openFileOutput(), getSharedPreferences(), andopenOrCreateDatabase() (which are all also defined in the class android.content.Context).
Static taint flow analysis can be done for a set of apps, to trace data from each source (an input of data which cannot be fully predicted by static analysis, e.g., text input by a user) to reachable sinks (data output to a location that other applications or methods can access, e.g., sending the data over a Bluetooth connection). Taint flow analysis helps users understand many possible source to sink flows, including flows that include intents and/or static fields.

This non-compliant code example shows an application that creates a file that is world readable, and hence not secure.

openFileOutput("someFile", MODE_WORLD_READABLE);

Any application could read the file and access any data stored in it.
 

 
In this compliant solution the file is created using MODE_PRIVATE, so it can be accessed only by the app that created the file.
openFileOutput("someFile", MODE_PRIVATE);



Typically, malicious code steals sensitive information (passwords, session cookies, personally identifiable information, etc). Hence, the associated business impacts include:
▪	Fraud
▪	Privacy Violations
