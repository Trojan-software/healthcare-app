The application is signed using v1 signature scheme which makes it vulnerable to Janus Vulnerability on unpatched Android 5.1.1 to 8.0. Please note that apps that are dual signed with v1 and v2 or v3 are still vulnerable on devices that does not enforce rollback protection on the specified unpatched Android versions supporting v2 and above.
The Application is vulnerable to Janus Vulnerability (CVE-2017-13156).



Application is signed using v1 scheme.


Sign the apk using scheme v2 and above.


An attacker can prepend a malicious DEX file to an APK file without affecting its signature which the Android runtime accepts as a valid update of a legitimate earlier version of the app.
