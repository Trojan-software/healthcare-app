Report Summary
This report is generated based on the findings during the automated auditing process. It also contains the process of
discovering those vulnerabilities in the first place, and ways to remediate those issues.
Audit Summary
Network Security Misconfiguration Static
This technique allows the user to secure the communication in the application by specifying
proper values to the flags which are present in the network security configuration file. If
implemented correctly it can help in securing the application by communicating only on
secure protocols like HTTPS. It can also be used to implement certificate pinning by using
the SHA-256 hashes of the public certificate.
9.1
Critical
Hardcoded Secrets Static
Malicious actors could take advantage of the hardcoded secrets to access private
databases, leading to data breaches and the exposure of users' personal data.
7.5
High
Hooking Detection Dynamic
Hooking is a technique where an external piece of code intercepts or manipulates the
normal execution flow of an application or the operating system. While legitimate uses of
hooking exist, such as for debugging and development purposes, malicious applications
may use hooking to compromise the security and integrity of the system. Hooking detection
is a technique to detect whether an application is being hooked at run time.
5.7
Medium
Root Detection Dynamic
Since a rooted device is much more at risk of being compromised, it is important to know
about it. Detecting whether the device is rooted or not is essential for further security
measures.
6.8
Medium
WebView Exploits Dynamic
WebView can be susceptible to various exploits including client side Javascript injection and
network sniffing if improperly implemented.

Android Tapjacking Static
Android tapjacking is a type of attack where an attacker tricks or deceives a user into
tapping on a seemingly harmless element on their Android device's screen, while secretly
performing malicious actions in the background. Cybercriminals deploy overlay attacks to
steal victims’ login credentials, bank card details, and other confidential information.
4.8
Medium
StrandHogg Vulnerability Static
One or more than one public facing activities of the application is vulnerable to StandHogg
vulnerability.
In StrandHogg and regular task hijacking, malicious applications typically deploy one of the
following techniques or a selection in tandem:
Task Affinity Manipulation: The malicious application leverages two activities, M1
and M2, wherein M2.taskAffinity = com.victim.app and M2.allowTaskReparenting =
true. In the eventuality that the malicious app is opened on M2, M2 would be
relocated to the front and the user will interact with the malicious application once
the victim application has initiated.
Single Task Mode: In the eventuality that the victim application sets launchMode to
singleTask, malicious applications can leverage M2.taskAffinity = com.victim.app to
hijack the victim's application task stack.
Task Reparenting: In the eventuality that the victim application sets
taskReparenting to true, malicious applications can move the victim's application
task to the malicious application's stack.
However, in the case of StrandHogg 2.0, all exported activities without a launchMode of
singleTask or singleInstance are affected on vulnerable Android versions.
6.5
Medium
MediaProjection: Android Service Allows Recording of Audio, Screen Activity
Static
Protect all sensitive windows within the App by enabling the FLAG_SECURE flag. This flag will
prevent Apps from being able to record the protected windows. Also, the flag will prevent
users from taking screenshots of these windows (by pressing the VOLUME_DOWN and
POWER buttons). As such screenshots are stored on the SDCard by default, they are
accessible to all Apps and sensitive data may be exposed.
6.8
Medium
Insecure Broadcast Receivers registered dynamically Static
Broadcast Receivers which are set Dynamically and are not protected
6.1
Medium
Disabled SSL CA Validation and Certificate Pinning Static
A host or service's certificate or public key can be added to an application at development
time, or it can be added upon first encountering the certificate or public key. The former -
adding at development time - is preferred since preloading the certificate or public key out
of band usually means the attacker cannot taint the pin.

Storing Information in Shared Preferences Dynamic
Insecured information was found in shared preference. One shouldn't use un-encrypted
information in SharedPreference.
6.1
Medium
Android Developer options status detection Dynamic
Implementing Developer options protection in Android applications is crucial to ensure
security and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive features and data. Implementing
Developer option protection in your Android application enhances its security and integrity.
By detecting and responding to the enabling of developer options, you can prevent
unauthorized access and protect sensitive data.
3.4
Low
Android Developer Bridge(ADB) status detection Dynamic
Implementing ADB detection in Android applications is crucial to ensure security and
prevent unauthorized access to sensitive features and data. ADB detection enhances app
security by guarding against unintended exposure, unauthorized access, and tampering. By
detecting and responding to the enabling of ADB on the device, you can prevent
unauthorized access and protect sensitive data.
3.4
Low
Bytecode Obfuscation Static
Java source code is typically compiled into Java bytecode – the instruction set of the Java
virtual machine. The compiled Java bytecode can be easily reversed engineered back into
source code by freely available decompilers. Bytecode Obfuscation is the process of
modifying Java bytecode (executable or library) so that it is much harder to read and
understand for a hacker but remains fully functional.
2.3
Low
Enabled Android Application Backup Static
Application backup might contain sensitive information private data of the app into their PC
3.3
Low
Keylogger Protection Static
Keyloggers are malicious software designed to capture and record keystrokes or input data
from users, posing a significant threat to personal and sensitive information. They operate
by monitoring keyboard activity, potentially stealing passwords, credit card details, and
other confidential data. Keylogger protection involves implementing secure input methods,
such as custom keyboards and virtual keyboards, to prevent unauthorized access to typed
information. Effective protection ensures that even if a keylogger is present, it cannot
intercept or compromise the data being entered.
3.9
Low
Weak PRNG (Pseudorandom number generator) Static
Weak PRNG vulnerabilities stem from insufficiently random initializations, improper
algorithms, or inadequate entropy sources. Such vulnerabilities can result in unauthorized
access, data breaches, and compromised cryptographic operations.

Network Security Misconfiguration
The Network Security Configuration feature lets apps customize their network security settings in a safe, declarative
configuration file without modifying app code. These settings can be configured for specific domains and for a specific
app. The key capabilities of this feature are as follows:
Custom trust anchors: Customize which Certificate Authorities (CA) are trusted for an app's secure
connections. For example, trusting particular self-signed certificates or restricting the set of public CAs that the
app trusts.
Debug-only overrides: Safely debug secure connections in an app without added risk to the installed base.
Cleartext traffic opt-out: Protect apps from accidental usage of cleartext traffic.
Certificate pinning: Restrict an app's secure connection to particular certificates.

This technique allows the user to secure the communication in the application by specifying proper values to the flags
which are present in the network security configuration file. If implemented correctly it can help in securing the
application by communicating only on secure protocols like HTTPS. It can also be used to implement certificate pinning
by using the SHA-256 hashes of the public certificate.
Android manifest's application tag has `cleartextTrafficPermitted` attribute set to `true`.This
is a vulnerability since it allows HTTP traffic.
If you have set the base configuration or domain configuration with cleartextTrafficPermitted to True then it is a
problem. If the src is set to "user" then, a user can install his own certificate in the device and the app will use that
instead of the pinned certificate.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config>
<base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
<trust-anchors>
<certificates src="system" />
<certificates src="user" />
</trust-anchors>

Adding a debug-overrides can expose your debug certificate which can be used to perform MITM attack on your
application.

Hooking is a technique where an external piece of code intercepts or manipulates the normal execution flow of an
application or the operating system. While legitimate uses of hooking exist, such as for debugging and development
purposes, malicious applications may use hooking to compromise the security and integrity of the system. Hooking
detection is a technique to detect whether an application is being hooked at run time.
The application has not implemented hooking detection or any kind of runtime protection system.
To implement a hooking detection solution, the following code (in Java or Kotlin) can be used to enumerate packages
and figure out malicious tools. This should be used in conjunction with the native (C/C++) code to make detection
more stronger and efficient.
Java:
function checkSuspiciousMethodsinStackTrace() {

WebView Exploits
Android API offers WebView to deliver a web application (or just a web page) as a part of a client app. A common
scenario in which using WebView is helpful is when you want to provide information in your application that you might
need to update, such as an end-user agreement or a user guide. Another scenario is if your application provides data
to the user that always requires an Internet connection to retrieve data, such as email. In this case, you might find that
it's easier to build a WebView in your Android application that shows a web page with all the user data, rather than
performing a network request, then parsing the data and rendering it in an Android layout.

When using WebView, ensure the following:
Use WebView to load only trusted content
Always load resources over HTTPS
Avoid using Javascript within WebView. If Javascript is absolutely required, be sure that each context is escaped
properly by using an XSS filter component such as the OWASP Java Encoder Project
Accept only plain-text user input and sanitize it before displaying in WebView
An improperly implemented WebView instance may be vulnerable to XSS can be used to gain access to shared
preference files using file:///. When Javascript is enabled, it may allow adversaries to perform XSS attacks.
Furthermore, not loading WebView over HTTPS may allow attackers to sniff data from network transmissions and
perform Man-in-the-Middle attack by injecting arbitrary JavaScript into the WebView.

In StrandHogg and regular task hijacking, malicious applications typically deploy one of the following techniques or a
selection in tandem:
Task Affinity Manipulation: The malicious application leverages two activities, M1 and M2, wherein
M2.taskAffinity = com.victim.app and M2.allowTaskReparenting = true. In the eventuality that the malicious app
is opened on M2, M2 would be relocated to the front and the user will interact with the malicious application
once the victim application has initiated.
Single Task Mode: In the eventuality that the victim application sets launchMode to singleTask, malicious
applications can leverage M2.taskAffinity = com.victim.app to hijack the victim's application task stack.
Task Reparenting: In the eventuality that the victim application sets taskReparenting to true, malicious
applications can move the victim's application task to the malicious application's stack.
However, in the case of StrandHogg 2.0, all exported activities without a launchMode of singleTask or singleInstance
are affected on vulnerable Android versions.
The launchMode for public activity com.web2native.MainActivity is set as singleTask. As a
result, a malicious applications can leverage taskAffinity='com.victim.app' to hijack the

A malicious app could leverage this weakness to manipulate the way in which users interact with the app. Specifically,
this could be instigated by relocating a malicious attacker-controlled activity in the screen flow of the user, which may
prove useful towards performing phishing, DoS or user-credential capture. This issue has been verified as a known

Insecure Broadcast Receivers registered

A BroadcastReceiver represents one main component of an essential publish/subscribe messaging platform in Android.
It, known as a subscriber, can be used to receive and respond to specific messages (or broadcasts) from the system or
other components in the same application or different applications, such as notifying Android users when cellphone
power is low as a system event-driven. This is generally achieved through the utilization of intent filters defined in the
app manifest file.
The dynamically Broadcastreceiver is in the java source code to realize the broadcast mechanism using onReceive().
This mechanism is managed by the Activity Manager Service (AMS) on the second framework layer in the Android

them without needing any permissions.
Secondly if the receiver goes on to use the extras sent with the broadcast, or to start running other functions, then the
malware has a whole new entry point to yTheour application.
To protect broadcast, it needs to be registered with permissions when it is declare.
Secondly never trust the data that is being sent with it. It's passing through a trust zone to arrive in the app, so it

A host or service's certificate or public key can be added to an application at development time, or it can be added
upon first encountering the certificate or public key. The former - adding at development time - is preferred since
preloading the certificate or public key out of band usually means the attacker cannot taint the pin.
SSL Pinning is not implemented in the Application.
Certificate Pinning can be done with these two options:
You can 1. pin the certificate or 2. pin the public key
If you choose public keys, you have two additional choices: - pin the subjectPublicKeyInfo or - pin one of the
concrete types such as RSAPublicKey or DSAPublicKey.
The three choices are explained below in more detail. I would encourage you to pin the subjectPublicKeyInfo because it
has the public parameters (such as {e,n} for an RSA public key) and contextual information such as an algorithm and
OID. The context will help you keep your bearings at times, and the figure to the right shows the additional information
available.
Certificate
The certificate is easiest to pin. You can fetch the certificate out of band for the website, have the IT folks email your
company certificate to you, use openssl s_client to retrieve the certificate etc. At runtime, you retrieve the website or
server's certificate in the callback. Within the callback, you compare the retrieved certificate with the certificate
embedded within the program. If the comparison fails, then fail the method or function. There is a downside to pinning
a certificate. If the site rotates its certificate on a regular basis, then your application would need to be updated
regularly. For example, Google rotates its certificates, so you will need to update your application about once a month
(if it depended on Google services). Even though Google rotates its certificates, the underlying public keys (within the
certificate) remain static.
Public Key
Public key pinning is more flexible but a little trickier due to the extra steps necessary to extract the public key from a
certificate. As with a certificate, the program checks the extracted public key with its embedded copy of the public key.
There are two downsides to public key pinning. First, it's harder to work with keys (versus certificates) since you must
extract the key from the certificate. Extraction is a minor inconvenience in Java and .Net, buts it's uncomfortable in
Cocoa/CocoaTouch and OpenSSL. Second, the key is static and may violate key rotation policies.
Hashing
While the three choices above used DER encoding, its also acceptable to use a hash of the information. In fact, the
original sample programs were written using digested certificates and public keys. The samples were changed to allow
a programmer to inspect the objects with tools like dumpasn1 and other ASN.1 decoders.
Hashing also provides three additional benefits. First, hashing allows you to anonymize a certificate or public key. This
might be important if you application is concerned about leaking information during decompilation and re-engineering.
Second, a digested certificate fingerprint is often available as a native API for many libraries, so its convenient to use.
Finally, an organization might want to supply a reserve (or back-up) identity in case the primary identity is
compromised. Hashing ensures your adversaries do not see the reserved certificate or public key in advance of its use.
In fact, Google's IETF draft websec-key-pinning uses the technique.

In Android apps, data can be communicated via intents, or data can be written to files, distributed using shared
references, or stored in databases. In all these cases, if the data is sensitive, it is important to keep the data secure.
That is, it should not be possible for other apps (or, more strictly, apps with different userids) to be able to access this
data, or for the data to be accessible to other programs or people, if the data owner does not intend that.
Data security (for non-intent communication channels) can be supported by creating the file, shared preference or
database with MODE_PRIVATE on internal storage or with MODE_PRIVATE and encrypted (using secure encryption
techniques, and using an encryption key only secure parties/apps have) on external storage. MODE_PRIVATE is a
constant defined by the class android.content.Context. It may be used as the mode parameter in the methods
openFileOutput(), getSharedPreferences(), andopenOrCreateDatabase() (which are all also defined in the class
android.content.Context).
Static taint flow analysis can be done for a set of apps, to trace data from each source (an input of data which cannot
be fully predicted by static analysis, e.g., text input by a user) to reachable sinks (data output to a location that other
applications or methods can access, e.g., sending the data over a Bluetooth connection). Taint flow analysis helps
users understand many possible source to sink flows, including flows that include intents and/or static fields.

Bytecode Obfuscation
Generally, all mobile code is susceptible to reverse engineering. Some apps are more susceptible than others. Code
written in languages / frameworks that allow for dynamic introspection at runtime (Java, .NET, Objective C, Swift) are
particularly at risk for reverse engineering. Detecting susceptibility to reverse engineering is fairly straight forward.
First, decrypt the app store version of the app (if binary encryption is applied). Code will be susceptible if it is fairly
easy to understand the app’s controlflow path, string table, and any pseudocode/source-code generated by these
tools.
Bytecode obfuscation consists of multiple complementary techniques that can help create a layered defense against
reverse engineering and tampering. Some typical examples of obfuscation techniques include:
Renaming to alter the name of methods and variables to make the decompiled source much harder for a
human to understand.
Control Flow Obfuscationcreates conditional, branching, and iterative constructs that produce valid
executable logic, but yield non-deterministic semantic results when decompiled.
String Encryption hides strings in the executable and only restores their original value when needed
Instruction Pattern Transformation converts common instructions to other, less obvious constructs potential
confusing decompliers.
Dummy Code Insertion inserts code that does not affect the program’s logic, but breaks decompilers or
makes reverse-engineered code harder to analyze.
Unused Code and Metadata Removal prunes out debug, non-essential metadata and used code from
applications to reduce the information available to an attacker.

Java source code is typically compiled into Java bytecode – the instruction set of the Java virtual machine. The
compiled Java bytecode can be easily reversed engineered back into source code by freely available decompilers.
Bytecode Obfuscation is the process of modifying Java bytecode (executable or library) so that it is much harder to
read and understand for a hacker but remains fully functional.
Application is vulnerable to reverse engineering without any obfuscation
Sample proguard-rules.pro lines which fails obfuscation when used:

Or if no proguard or obfuscation is used then you can use number of freely available Java decompilers that can

Weak PRNG vulnerabilities stem from insufficiently random initializations, improper algorithms, or inadequate entropy
sources. Such vulnerabilities can result in unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromised cryptographic
operations.

Weak PRNG (Pseudorandom Number Generator) vulnerabilities within Android applications can have far-reaching
business consequences. Such vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches and unauthorized access, undermining user
trust and potentially violating regulatory requirements. Financial losses may result from legal actions, compensations,
and operational disruptions caused by security incidents. Moreover, a compromised reputation can lead to decreased
user adoption, loss of competitive advantage, and even app removal from stores

Deprecated setPluginState in WebView
The mobile application uses a deprecated setPluginState method in WebView. The "setPluginState" method was
deprecated in Android’s API level 18 because plugins will not be supported anymore in the future and should not be
used. Example of plugins are embedded PDF reader, Flash plugin, etc.

Unused Permissions
An app might request a user for certain permissions, like access to SD card, contacts, social profiles, etc. which has not
actually been invoked while the scan was running. We list out all these permissions so that you can optimize your app
and follow proper compliance checks.

Do not request for permissions beyond what your app actually needs
Users may not download your app when presented with a long list of permissions. Imagine a flashlight app requesting
access to SD card, camera, contacts, SMS and more. This is an invitation to poor ratings and reviews on App Stores.
This also breaks compliance standards.
