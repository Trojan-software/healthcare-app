CWE	CWE-942	https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/942.html


MSTG	MSTG-PLATFORM-6	WebViews are configured to allow only the minimum set of
protocol handlers required (ideally, only https is supported). Potentially dangerous handlers, such as file, tel and app-id, are disabled.

OWASP MASVS (v2)	MASVS-PLATFORM-2	The app uses WebViews securely.

Javascript in the Webview having CORS enabled to be loaded from file and any arbitrary URL

setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs is set to True which is Insecured and found in Lcom/ digitaloperaocean/webviewcode/MainActivity;->webViewSetting (Landroid/webkit/WebView;)V
setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs is set to True which is Insecured and found in Lcom/ digitaloperaocean/webviewcode/MainActivity;->webViewSetting (Landroid/webkit/WebView;)V
 
setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs is set to True which is Insecured and found in Lcom/ digitaloperaocean/webviewcode/MainActivity;->webViewSetting (Landroid/webkit/WebView;)V



Example of an insecure code :

WebSettings settings = getSettings(); settings.setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs(true) settings.setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs(true)



Below is an example of how to prevent the application from Javascript CORS issue:

WebSettings settings = getSettings(); settings.setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs(false) settings.setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs(false)
