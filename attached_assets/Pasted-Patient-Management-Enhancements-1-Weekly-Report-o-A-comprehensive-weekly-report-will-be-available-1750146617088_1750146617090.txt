Patient Management Enhancements
1.	Weekly Report
o	A comprehensive weekly report will be available.
o	Users can apply filters to view data within a specific date range and by vital sign type (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate).
2.	Next Check-Up Scheduling
o	Patients can select specific vital signs they wish to monitor (e.g., blood pressure, temperature, oxygen saturation).
o	Users can configure automated check-up intervals (e.g., every 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours) based on their needs or physician recommendations.
3.	Health History Overview
o	The system will display a chronological history of all recorded vital signs.
o	Data will be grouped by date and time, allowing users and healthcare providers to analyze trends and changes over time.
4.	Vital Sign Recording
o	Manual entry will be disabled to ensure data accuracy.
o	The system will automatically retrieve vital sign readings from the connected HC03 device.
o	Partial readings are supported: if only one or a subset of vital signs is measured (e.g., only blood pressure), the system will still record and display the available data.
FAQ & Device Usage Instructions
•	A dedicated FAQ section will be added to assist users with common questions related to the device and platform.
•	This section will include:
o	Step-by-step instructional videos demonstrating how to use the device effectively.
o	Visual guides and text-based instructions for setup, troubleshooting, and interpreting vital sign readings.
•	Content will be categorized for quick access (e.g., Device Setup, How to Measure Blood Pressure, Understanding Your Health Data).
•	FAQs and videos will be updated periodically based on user feedback and new device features.
Critical Alerts Notification
•	The system will support automated critical alerts for abnormal or life-threatening vital signs.
•	When a critical threshold is detected (e.g., dangerously high blood pressure or low oxygen levels), the system will:
o	Automatically send an email notification to the assigned doctor.
•	The doctor’s email address will be configured and managed via the Admin Dashboard, ensuring flexibility and control.
•	The alert email will include:
o	Patient name and ID
o	Timestamp of the critical reading
o	Type and value of the abnormal vital sign
o	Link to the patient’s full health history for immediate review
